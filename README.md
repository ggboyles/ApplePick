# Apple Picker

## Project Description

**Made using Unity and C# for CS 382**

Apple Picker is a Unity game where the player moves a basket to catch apples while avoiding branches.

This project is based on the **ApplePicker** tutorial from the book:

*Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development - Third Edition* by **Jeremy Gibson Bond**

In addition to the tutorial, I added several features:

- Round system that progresses through four levels
- Branches, a new falling object player must avoid
